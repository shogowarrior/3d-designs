# Summary

<b>Greenhouse-Dome (clickable)</b>
(Treibhausdom für Kräuter und Pflanzen - zusammensteckbar)

Your seed, seedlings and plants also need a warm environment?

Based on the two Mini-dome parts hexa and penta from obijuan, i made a Greenhouse-Dome and other parts. With the parts here you can build a full (small) greenhouse-dome! All you need is a piece of PVC foil and a 3D printer. Even the connecting pieces can be printed if desired (or simply use wooden sticks). And the whole Greenhouse-Dome can be plugged together!

<b>New parts allow now a Greenhouse-Dome with any height!</b><br><br>


<b>For my greenhouse as in the picture above (the small white-green dome), you need the following parts + a pvc-foil:</b>

20x hexa (P-01)
6x penta (P-02)
40x A-Connector (P-03) or use 8 cm pvc-sticks
55x B-Connector (P-04) or use 9 cm pvc-sticks
10x hexa_V-Teil_fuer_Folie_V2 (P-30)
7x Folienklemme_schraeg_V2  (P-32)
3x Folienklemme_mit_Bodenanker_lang_schraeg_V2  (P-33) as ground anchor
+NEW: 10x Folienklemme (P-40)

Diameter: ca. 27-32 cm
Height: ca. 26 cm

<b>Note:</b> The big white dom in the fotos uses some of the new parts (see below the update from 22.05.2016).

You can find here also many other parts to download. For example, parts for a lower Greenhouse-Dome (3 level instead of 4-level high). Or a Dome-structure without foil. Or a garden house with individual height.

How the whole Dome is put together, you can see here (2V/L2 Icosahedron Dome). You'll find there also a Calculator for own stick length, if you want to build domes with different diameter.:

*<b>Advice:</b>  I noticed that the woodensticks can become moldy by the humid climate. I therefore recommend to print the connections. And remember airing from time to time. Or look for some air circulation at the bottom of the dome.*<br><br>


<b>Update:</b> 

28.05.2016: Added a few new pictures. More information on the new large dome which I made, here: http://www.thingiverse.com/make:224557

22.05.2016: <b>6 new pieces published (P-50, P-51, P-52, P-55, P-56 and P-57). These allow a Greenhouse-Dome with any height.</b>  According to the concept of my Flexible Mini Greenhouse-Dome with Pot: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1512115

18.05.2016: Improved connectors (P-03 and P-04) uploaded. They fit better and are slightly thicker in diameter. Therefore more stable. The deformation caused by the sun is also reduced. 

13.04.2016: I added a new clickpart P-40.<br><br>

<b>Note:</b> Looking for a small Greenhouse-Dome with Plant-Pot? Check out my newest greenhouse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1512115

Let your plants grow! Enjoy!

# Print Settings


Notes: 
I have the parts designed so that they can be printed without support. <br><br>

> The most parts I printed with 15% Infill.<br>
> The clickable V2-bottom-parts (P-31, P-32, P-33, P-34) and the Connecting parts (P-03, P-04) with 70-100% Infill.<br><br>

I printed it with PLA. But for the clickable V2-bottom-parts (P-31, P-32, P-33, P-34) is perhaps ABS better.

# Project:
Flexible clickable Greenhouse-Dome

## Overview & Background:

Your children think, the vegetables, fruits and herbs etc. are produced in the supermarket? With the project "Flexible clickable Greenhouse Dome" Children and students of different ages learn not only know the 3D printing technology, but also where our food comes from. They build a proper, growth-enhancing environment and can learn how vegetables, fruits and herbs, which they eat daily, thrive. They can alone or jointly build a small or large Greenhouse-Dome, sow seeds and plant seedlings, watch and reap the fruits of their labor.

## Objectives:

The children and students learn about the origin of food products. But they also learn about healthy eating, organic farming, the construction of objects and dealing with 3D technologies.

## Audiences:

Children in kindergarten are also delight to seed and to see vegetables and fruits grow how older students, that moreover deepens can enter into to the various subject areas of the dome design, 3D printing, ecology and planting etc.

## Lesson/Activity: 

In this project, very little material is needed to learn many things. A 3D printer, PVC-foil, seedlings or seeds, soil, water and sunlight. Whether only a small Greenhouse Dome is built on a flower pot in the classroom, each child / student makes its own Greenhouse Dome for their home or a XXL Dome is designed for the school garden, the use in the teaching area is as flexible as the Dome himself.

Older students can for example improve existing parts and develop further dome parts. For example, in the direction of my "Mini Greenhouse Dome with Pot and Sign" (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1512115) or a XXL Greenhouse Dome with entrance / door and ventilation etc. <em>(When students develop my dome parts via this challenge #MakerEdChallenge2 and publish their new parts, developments and insights for free under a free license (Creative Commons, Open Source etc.), I will share my parts as well under a license such as CC BY-SA 3.0.)</em>
