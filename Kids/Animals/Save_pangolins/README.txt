# Summary

  Pangolins now are facing critical crisis as they are closing to extinct. In fact, humans are the murderers of this disaster, superstition and greed are the main reason to cause this massacre. 
 Pangolins, the mammals covered in tough and overlapping scales, are actually far from aggressive. Their scales provide good defense against predators in wild. However, they’re considered the world’s most hunted animal because people believe that the meat is prized for medicinal ingredient and the scales help curl impotence.
Nowadays, the numbers of pangolins are less and less, some people eat them only for the reason of showing their ostentatious wealth, what they do to these helpless animals is to make them approach to endangered. Although International trade in pangolins has been banned by CITES since 2000; and are listed them as 'protected species' in most Asian home states, scaly anteaters are still threaten with smuggling and poaching. Pangolins’ disappear would not be the result we expect to see, only when strictly implement of law enforcement on punishing these poachers and pangolin-eaters would effectively bring down the crisis of extinction. This is our latest chance to save pangolins, and please never make science predictions come true.   

  Pangolin is a really skillful and difficult work that I have spent a lot of time on it. It has been passed at least six editions before presenting to all of you. What I was trying to challenge is an artwork with both perfect appearance and function. It was a little struggle for me to share this work at the beginning since I’ve fallen in love with it when it’s first done and stood in front of me. At this moment, what I am wondering more is to let you firsthand it, holding and feeling the variation with actions. Enjoy and I believe you’ll like it.  

 Same file will be uploaded to http://fastlab.tw/, (Institute for Information Industry, III), which is a 3D works sharing website, welcome all 3D players upload your works and have fun here!

   穿山甲正面臨迫切的危機，牠們走在快速滅絕道路上，人類是這場災難的兇手，迷信與貪婪是屠殺的原因。

   穿山甲這個性情溫和的動物，全身佈滿鱗片，這些鱗片在野外對於保護自己有些幫助，但是身上的鱗片也是牠們被獵殺的因素。因迷信穿山甲的鱗片有醫療與壯陽的效用，導致穿山甲這無辜的動物被瘋狂獵殺。也因為野外的穿山甲越來越少，所以穿山甲成了昂貴的食物，有些人僅僅是為了炫富而食用穿山甲，這樣的行為也把穿山甲推上最後的滅絕之路。雖然現在穿山甲在多個國家及地區均禁止出口及貿易，但是走私與盜獵依然存在！落實執法，逮捕並懲處這些盜獵者及食用者才能真正解決穿山甲的危機。科學家認為亞洲的穿山甲可能將於20年內滅絕！這不是我們想要的結果，現在就是解救穿山甲的最後機會。請別讓科學家的預言成真。

   這個作品我花了很多的時間，是一個難度很高的作品，自開始到完成創作至少修改了6個版本，不停地推翻與重建，因為我在挑戰一個美與機能都要兼具的作品。所以當我完成這個作品時，也同時愛上這個作品，因此有些捨不得分享出來。但我更期望朋友們也能夠親自體驗我的感受，能將牠握在手中，感覺牠的觸感、聲音與各種動態的變化。當你下載了並列印這作品時，願你也能像我一樣愛上這個作品。

同樣的檔案我也分享於 http://fastlab.tw/ 這是台灣資訊策進會的3D分享網頁，希望各位3D玩家也能慢慢豐富這個地方。

感謝  新光合成纖維股份公司  訂製專用顏色之3D列印材料贊助本作品創作。

列印建議
層高0.2mm
免支撐
縮小列印時請別小於0.75並提提高解析度到0.15mm
