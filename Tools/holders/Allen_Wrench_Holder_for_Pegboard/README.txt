# Summary

This is a derivative of the Pegboard Tool Holder Template (Base). I have included the code for the base, so you only need the .stl files included here. If you want to further customize it or otherwise modify the .scad files with openscad, you also need the "base.scad" module from the original that this is derived from.

The holder has a back row, slightly elevated, that has holes for SAE allen wrenches of sizes:
.050", 1/16", 5/64", 3/32", 7/64", 1/8", 9/64", 5/32", 3/16", 7/32", 1/4", 5/16" and 3/8"
the front row has holes for metric allen wrenches of sizes:
1.5mm, 2.0mm, 2.5mm, 3.0mm, 4.0mm, 4.5mm, 5.0mm, 5.5mm, 6.0mm, 7.0mm, 8.0mm, 10.0mm. 

You can adjust sizes in the openscad file that is included.



# Print Settings

Printer: FlashForge
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1mm
Infill: 15% for holder, 75% for sides

Notes: 
Very easy to print. No raft, no supports, no mess. Just snap the sides in and it's all set to go. Note, side.stl makes 4 side pieces, but you only need two for any given thing.
