# Summary

After recreating the screw used in the VTech Drill and Learn Toolbox (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2833206) my son started asking for a pliers.  That's what you see here.

Truth be told this is Version 4 of the wrench.  The first version only made it to the first few layers before I realized it was going to be more of a child's first boltcutter than a wrench.  Version 2 had too small a spindle which I realized as soon as it printed.  It survived about an hour.  Version 3 was pretty good, assembly was a bit tight but once together it works quite well.  But I really think part of the fun of these toys is being able to take the apart again after they're assembled so V4 just has a slightly enlarged hole.

Resolution: 0.1mm

Notes: 
I did bump the infill to 100% at 20.20mm to give the cap of the connector a bit more rigidity.  I'm not sure that's actually necessary but it seemed worth the extra PLA if it causes it to last a bit longer.
