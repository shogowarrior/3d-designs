# Summary

My 3 year old son has an Easter theme at school. All kids were asked to bring along Rabbits. As he is such a big fan of Flexi Rex, I decided to remix the T-rex into an Easter Bunny. 

I used the Flexi Rex with Stronger links from DrLex as a base. And as well applied the same eyebrow and eye. 

My son was super proud to take his rabbit with him to school. 

Do not forget to share a picture of your Flexi Rabbit when it is made. So Flexi can officially meet his brothers; sisters, nephews etc.

Thanks in advance!
