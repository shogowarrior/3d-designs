# Summary

I designed these after getting frustrated with my store bought stainless steel shower hooks that rusted and stopped sliding. It took multiple design styles and revisions to get it right. I think you'll really enjoy these.

Print 1 ea.(Roller.STL) for each hook. Then choose either the (Single_Hook.STL) or the
(Double_Hook.STL) for showers with 2 curtains. I've recently added 3rd option (U_Shape.STL) by request, this can be used to hold a curtain or curtains without hooks. Just install the curtain to the u shape before installing the roller.

These actually roll really well and are a real improvement from the store bought "Stainless" hooks that rust over time.

# Post-Printing

Installation Instructions:

Step1: Test fit the roller into the prongs of the hook by separating the hook prongs just enough to slip the roller into the hook. I used a fingernail sanding file to round off the prongs a little. Sand the hook prongs just enough until the roller spins easily.**because the hooks are printed horizontally the may have a flat spot on one side, the idea is to sand the flat spot round.

Step 2: Slightly separate the top of the hook then slide it over the shower curtain rod.

Step 3:  With the hook slid over the curtain rod separate the top of the hook again enough to slip the prongs into the roller hubs.
