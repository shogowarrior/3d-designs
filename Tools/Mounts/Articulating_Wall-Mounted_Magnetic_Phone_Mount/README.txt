# Summary

**Update (6/23/2018):  I'm sharing this Fusion 360 model(I hope I did it right):  https://a360.co/2KgA3Z9

I'm sorry to anyone who has tried to contact me.  I've been busy with a full-time job plus engineering classes.  Every time I log in, I see that I have infinity notifications waiting for me to address them. 

But, I finally took the time to figure out how to share the model so you can make changes or fix the model in any way you want.

I'm glad so many people have gotten use out of my design.

**Update (7/24/2017):  Important notes in the print settings.

I've been debating mounting a TV on the ceiling above my bed.  The only reason I haven't done it is because of a fear of being crushed by a falling TV while I'm sleeping.  

This design allows me to watch Youtube, Netflix, or other streaming video while I'm falling asleep.  

**Non-Printed Parts:**
[Adhesive Metal Plate for Magnetic Phone Mounts](https://www.amazon.com/Pop-Tech-Universal-Adhesive-Magnetic-Rectangular/dp/B00ZTUHRI4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1500831023&sr=8-4&keywords=magnetic+mount+plate)
[4-Pack Enkay 4480-C Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/Enkay-4480-C-8-Pound-Magnet-4-Piece/dp/B003UYA45Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500831147&sr=8-1&keywords=enkay+4480-c)
4x Screws that fit in a 5 mm hole with a head diameter no larger than 7.9 mm
4x Wall Anchors for those screws
Electrical Tape

If I had to guess on the screw size based on the charts I found online, I would say it's a #10 screw, but I designed the wall mount around some unlabeled screws and anchors I had lying around.




# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Wanhao
Printer: Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2 mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
**Highly Recommended Settings:**  Keep parts oriented as I've set them.  Some parts will require support.  The reasoning is that, when printed on my printer at 20%, there was a consistent weak spot at the base of the threading.  If you want to print without supports, you can reorient those parts in your slicer and print at a higher infill, maybe 50%.

Infill: 20%
Wall Width:  1.2 mm
Top Thickness:  1.2 mm

Also, for parts that have to fit together, I highly recommend using one printer to print all the parts.  I have found that one of my printers prints marginally larger (0.1-0.2 mm/20 mm), and on larger pieces, the tolerances will be off enough that the pieces will not fit right.


# Post-Printing

## Magnets

The bottom layers on both of my printers tend to screw with the tolerances.  I had to scrape the rims of the holes for the magnets before they would pop in, essentially widening the diameters for the first couple of layers.

## Magnetic Mount Cap

The electrical tape provides a higher-friction surface than the plastic provides.  Place a few strips across the surface of the cap that the phone will sit on, and this helps to prevent the phone from sliding.  

Make sure the cap is screwed down firmly to minimize the distance from the adhesive metal plate on the back of your phone and the magnets.
