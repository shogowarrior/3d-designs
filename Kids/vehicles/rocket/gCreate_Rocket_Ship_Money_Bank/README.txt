# Summary

We are proud to launch the latest gCreate rocket remix. This new model is now hollow with a coin slot on top. That's right you can now have your very own rocket money bank!

The model comes complete with a locking top cone that has a special pattern used to close or open it. We would like to design several of these patterns, including a very complicated one, to keep people out of the bank. This model will work with the existing smoke stand from the original model however we don't recommend using the stand if you fill the rocket with coins as it can get quite heavy.

We also are completing a series of tutorial videos on how we designed, sliced and printed this cool new rocket.

Part 4: Simplify3D Slicing Action:

Lastly, the model is manifold and we have removed the nozzle support at the bottom since many people had issues with it. We have also thickened some parts of the model and flattened the 3 fin curves for easier printing. 

About us:
gCreate designs, manufactures and sells the popular gMax 1.5+ and gMax 1.5 XT + 3d printers. The gMax is a large format desktop 3d printer with impressive build volumes of 3,072 in³ and 5,376 in³.

# Print Settings

Printer: gMax 1.5+
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes

Notes: 
We have removed the support for the main nozzle so you must make sure to generate support at the bottom. You can set the threshold to be basically flat since this is the only part requiring support.
