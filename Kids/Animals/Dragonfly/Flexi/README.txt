# Summary

I wanted to create a dragonfly model since my daughter and I found a dead dragonfly this summer. 

The overall proportions are based on the one we found. I tried to create a pattern for the wings which is similar to the real thing but with less detail to make it printable. 

Quite happy how it turned out :)

**Update Oct. 16th 2018**
The front wings of the patterned model were partially lifted (about 0.13 mm) above the the rest. Fixed and updated the stl. Thanks to [jerzone](https://www.thingiverse.com/jerzone) for letting me know in the comments!

**Update Oct. 18th 2018**
Made some small clean-ups to the patterned wings again, hopefully all slicers will work now without issues! No need to update if the previous version sliced correctly for you.
Thanks to [ericleejoe](https://www.thingiverse.com/ericleejoe) for reporting the problem with S3D slicer in the comments.

**Update Oct. 19th 2018**
Another small fix specific to Simplify 3D slicer. Welded the hanger hole piece to the tip of the tail instead of just having them overlap.
