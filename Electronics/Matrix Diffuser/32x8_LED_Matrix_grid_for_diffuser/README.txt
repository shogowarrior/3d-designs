# Summary

This is a 10mm grid to fit over a 32x8 LED matrix, as part of a diffuser panel for the LED matrix. As the full 32x8 grid would be too long to fit on some print beds, this was designed to be printed twice, and the two 16x8 parts will fit together.

The squares are spaced on a regular 10mm square grid, their internal size is 9.2mm and the walls between each square are 0.8mm thick.

The LED matrix came from ebay and was described as:
"WS2812B NeoPixel Addressable RGB LED Panel 5050 – 8×32 – 5V"
It looks very similar to these:
adafruit "Flexible 8x32 NeoPixel RGB LED Matrix" (PRODUCT ID: 2294)
Seeedstudio "RGB LED 32x8 Matrix (WS2812B) - 5V DC" (RB-See-420 / SEEED-104990128)

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Ultimaker
Printer: Ultimaker 2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.15mm
Infill: Light

Notes: 
Prints upside down to avoid overhangs. This model is designed to print as two identical 16x8 halves (92mm x 164.8mm x 5mm) which can be glued together to form a larger 32x8 matrix. It includes 8 mounting holes which are modelled at 3mm internal diameter, but after printing will end up about 2.6mm diameter. This was designed to fit over a flexible 32x8 LED matrix, and the grid includes clearances for the resistors that sit between the LEDs on the matrix.

The only (subtle) difference between the v08 and v09 files is a small 45 degree chamfer where the grid columns join the grid rows (this was a final tweak before printing).

Early testing with paper diffuser (it's just resting loosely on the grid, hence a little uneven).
