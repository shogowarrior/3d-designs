# Summary

This is a 1:1 scale Lego Skeleton featuring Lego compatibility, functioning ball joint arms, and a printed skull face. It is designed to be printable with a standard .4mm nozzle. Please read these notes before use.

Included Files:
- skull stl
- torso stl
- arm stl
- left leg stl
- right leg stl (identical to left, but rotated axially 180 degrees)
- full skeleton stl
- Stock Creality Ender 3 Pro Full Skeleton GCode


The print shown in the images was done using the included Gcode (SEE NOTES) on a stock Creality Ender 3 Pro with the stock .4mm nozzle and .06mm layer height at 100% infill. 

GCODE NOTES: Programmed specifically for use on the Creality Ender 3 Pro. Other printers may not be supported. Use at your own risk. Be advised, gcode uses 215C nozzle temp and 63C build plate temp for the filament I used, you may need to tune your machine on the fly for your filament. Printed directly on the magnetic build plate. First layer prints at .06mm height. Print time 1 hour 45 mins.

Slicer Setting Recommendations:
- Support Structures: touching build plate only.
- Ensure first layers print at .06mm increments for best surface finish.

Printer Setting Recommendations:
- Reduce speed of first 2 layers to 25% of nominal for smooth finish on back of torso and bottom of skull

Other Notes:
- The supports for the ball joint socket of the arms can be carefully trimmed with nippers
- This project is a compilation of models produced by others as well as my own (see design notes). Not intended for commercial use or resale.
- Silver filament makes it look like the Terminator
- Patience is a virtue

HAPPY PRINTING!

# How I Designed This

Skull / face redesigned in Fusion 360 using commonly available references. Female ball joint modified for 3D printing (deepened socket, support structures) modeled in TinkerCAD. Sliced with AstroPrint.
